This project is designed to be an aid with packing, particularly for a family with large amounts of bags or places they could store things. It works by creating items and bags according to what you need to pack and where you will be packing it. Then the user is able to place items in different bags and even move them around if need be. The user is also able to see the contents of each bag and the total list of items. The user can also save their list of items and bags and load it again in the program later.
